  <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
  <p><strong>I have begun learning to code at <span class="school">Epicodus</span>. Here are some projects I have done.</strong></p>
  <p><em>They are simple but this is just the beginning!</em></p>
  <ol reversed>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dani-renner/Pet-Page">a page about my pets and my partner from that day's pets</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dani-renner/Favorite-Places">a page about my favorite places</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dani-renner/remote-hello-world">and of course, a "hello world" page that kicked things off</a></li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="section">My Background:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Education</li>
    <p>I got a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theatre Arts from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.  A few years later, I took a couple classes in CSCI at a community college. They were Intro to Programming and Programming in C. I thought my company at the time would be reimbursing me, but unfortunately they said it didn't apply to my job and ultimately I had to pay for it myself. Then, I got my Real Estate Salesperson license online, and helped my parents with a couple sales.</p>
    <li>Work</li>
    <p>I have been working since I was fourteen years old. My first job was a chef at the Metrodome. I worked several retail jobs over the years at TJ Maxx, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Charlotte Russe. </p>
  </ul>
