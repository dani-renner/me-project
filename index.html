  <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
  <p><strong>I have begun learning to code at <span class="school">Epicodus</span>. Here are some projects I have done.</strong></p>
  <p><em>They are simple but this is just the beginning!</em></p>
  <ol reversed>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dani-renner/Pet-Page">a page about my pets and my partner from that day's pets</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dani-renner/Favorite-Places">a page about my favorite places</a></li>

  <p><span class="section">My Background:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Education</li>
    <p>I got a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theatre Arts from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.  A few years later, I took a couple classes in CSCI at a community college. They were Intro to Programming and Programming in C. I thought my company at the time would be reimbursing me, but unfortunately they said it didn't apply to my job and ultimately I had to pay for it myself. Then, I got my Real Estate Salesperson license online, and helped my parents with a couple sales.</p>
    <li>Work</li>
    <p>I have been working since I was fourteen years old. My first job was a chef at the Metrodome. I worked several retail jobs over the years at TJ Maxx, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Charlotte Russe. I also was a cook at the dining hall in college. I worked in the dorm where the athletes lived, and let me tell you, they sure ate a lot. After that, I upgraded my food service job by becoming a barista instead at Dunn Bros Coffees located inside a library on campus. I became manager after a year there. I also worked at a gas station. Oh, I was a dance and yoga instructor too. I worked so much because school was so expensive. After finishing college, I moved to Florence, Italy and au paired for a few months. When I came back to the States, I went back to making coffee. Then I got a full-time job at Optum. I was a provider fraud investigator. My goal was to find fraudulent medical claims and make sure they did not get paid out. However, most of the flags came from analytics, so all-in-all, my job was comparable to data entry, since I was inputting claim numbers and member numbers, etc. all day, every weekday for four and a half years. I also do whatever acting and modeling opportunities present themselves to me.</p>
    <li>Interests, Hobbies, and Skills</li>
    <p>I like to play video games, watch anime, and go hiking. I love animals! In the beforetimes, I could be found at concerts quite frequently. I listen to electronic music mostly and I love to dance. I also like to be a beer snob and go to breweries with the friends, but I've been on the stay at home grind, and I will continue to be until I am vaccinated!</p>
